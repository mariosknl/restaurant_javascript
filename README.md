# PROJECT: Restaurant Page - Javascript

This is a website for a Greek Restaurant. It has 3 different pages. All of them were created with JS and webpack. I am using SaSS for the styling. The webpack plugins I'm using are:
- css loader
- file loader
- html webpack plugin
- optimize css assets webpack plugin
- sass loader
- style loader
- webpack dev server
- bootstrap
- clean webpack plugin
- jquery
- popper

I also used Bootstrap for the main content.
